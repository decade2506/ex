<p style="color: white; font-size: 200%" align="Center">Summoning Archtype this will help you get a better understanding of summon in general</p>
<hr>
<p style="color: white; font-size: 200%" align="left">A Summon is an action which places a monster onto a Monster Zone. It can be performed either manually or with a card effect.</p>
	<p style="color: white; font-size: 200%" align="left">Monsters are always Summoned face-up, unless Special Summoning with an effect like "Morphing Jar 2" which states that the monster is Special Summoned face-down.</p>
	<p style="color: white; font-size: 200%" align="left">If a player conduct a Summon, due to any method, the player conducting that Summon will be the one who choose which appropriate Monster Zone the Monster would be placed on (unless specified otherwise).</p>
	<h2 style="color: white; font-size: 360%; text-align: left; font-family: Times New Roman;">Summoning type</h2>
	<h3 style="color: white; font-size: 280%; text-align: left; font-family: Times New Roman;">Normal summoning</h3>
	<p style="color: white; font-size: 200%" align="left">A Normal Summon is the simplest way to Summon a monster. The turn player can perform a Normal Summon
	during their Main Phase when the game state is open.</p>
	<h3 style="color: white; font-size: 280%; text-align: left; font-family: Times New Roman;">Tribute summoning</h3>
	<p style="color: white; font-size: 200%" align="left">Tribute Summon called Advance Summon in the OCG and the Yu-Gi-Oh! and Yu-Gi-Oh! GX anime series.</p>
	<p style="color: white; font-size: 200%" align="left">By default, Level 5 and 6 monsters require one Tribute, while Level 7 and higher require two Tributes.
	Tribute Summon counts toward the turn's Normal Summon/Set limit.</p>
	<p style="color: white; font-size: 200%" align="left">Tributing a monster for a Tribute Summon is part of a Summoning condition. Therefore, if the Tribute Summon is negated,
	the Tributed monster(s) will not return to the field.</p>
	<p style="color: white; font-size: 200%" align="left">If no cards are Tributed to perform the Normal Summon of a Level 5 or higher monster (as in the case of "Mausoleum of the Emperor")
	, the Summon is not a Tribute Summon, unless a card specifies otherwise (such as "Tribute Burial").</p>
	<h3 style="color: white; font-size: 280%; text-align: left; font-family: Times New Roman;">Flip summoning</h3>
	<img src="./images/flip.jpg" align="right" style="border: 3px solid red;" height="356px" width="250px">
	<p style="color: white; font-size: 200%" align="left">A Flip Summon is a way to Summon monsters. It can only be performed when the game state is open during your Main Phase. You simply
	flip a face-down monster manually into face-up Attack Position. A monster is considered to be not on the Field during the Flip Summon's Summon negation window. Flip Summon is simultaneously
	regarded as both a Summon and Battle position change.</p>
	<p style="color: white; font-size: 200%" align="left">A face-down monster flipped into face-up Attack Position by a card effect such as "Book of Taiyou" or "Ancient Forest" is not considered
	a Flip Summon. Flip Summon does not take up your Normal Summon/Set for the turn.</p>
	<p style="color: white; font-size: 200%" align="left">You cannot Flip Summon a monster at the same turn it was Summoned, Normal Set, declared an attack (even if the attack was negated or canceled),
	or its battle position was changed manually that turn.</P>
	<h3 style="color: white; font-size: 280%; text-align: left; font-family: Times New Roman;">Special summoning</h3>
	<h4 style="color: white; font-size: 250%; text-align: left; font-family: Times New Roman;">Fusion summoning</h4>
	<img src="./images/fuse.jpg" align="left" style="border: 3px solid red;" height="356px" width="250px">
	<p style="color: white; font-size: 200%" align="left">A Fusion Summon is the act of Special Summoning a Fusion Monster from the Extra Deck using the effect of a card that states that it performs a Fusion Summon.</p>
	<p style="color: white; font-size: 200%" align="left">A player can Fusion Summon a Fusion Monster from the Extra Deck by activating a card or effect that performs a Fusion Summon. When that effect resolves,
	the player uses appropriate Fusion Materials listed on a Fusion Monster by moving them from some location(s) to another location, as specified by the effect performing the Fusion Summon (usually sending them
	to the Graveyard; as in the implicit case of "Polymerization" and other effects stating "using monsters as Fusion Materials"). After that, the player Summons the Fusion Monster from the Extra Deck to an unoccupied
	Main Monster Zone or an Extra Monster Zone in face-up Attack or Defense Position.</p>
	<p style="color: white; font-size: 200%" align="left">Even if all appropriate Monster Zones are occupied, a Fusion Monster can still be Fusion Summoned as long as at least one of the Fusion Materials used is in one
	of these Zones, so that there is an available Zone when the Fusion Monster is Summoned.</p>
	<h4 style="color: white; font-size: 250%; text-align: left; font-family: Times New Roman;">ritual summoning</h4>
	<img src="./images/rit.jpg" align="right" style="border: 3px solid red;" height="356px" width="250px">
	<p style="color: white; font-size: 200%" align="left">A Ritual Summon is a method of Special Summoning a Ritual Monster from the hand with the use of Ritual Spell Card.</p>
	<p style="color: white; font-size: 200%" align="left">A player can Ritual Summon a Ritual Monster by activating a card or effect that performs a Ritual Summon, usually
	a Ritual Spell Card. When that effect resolves, the player satisfies the requirements of that card or effect which Ritual Summons, usually Tributing monsters from their
	hand and/or field, whose Levels combined equal or exceed the Ritual Monster's. After that, the player Summons the Ritual Monster from the hand (or other specified location)
	to an unoccupied Main Monster Zone in face-up Attack or Defense Position.</p>
	<p style="color: white; font-size: 200%" align="left">When a card or effect that Ritual Summons resolves, if the requirement cannot be met or the Ritual Monster cannot be Ritual Summoned,
	no Ritual Summon occurs, nor is any action taken for the Ritual Summon's requirement. For example, if a player cannot Special Summon when resolving a Ritual Spell Card that Tributes monsters,
	no monsters are Tributed.</p>
	<p style="color: white; font-size: 200%" align="left">If the card or effect that Ritual Summons does not mandate an exact total Level (e.g. "You must also Tribute monsters from your hand
	or field whose total Levels equal 6 or more."), the player cannot Tribute additional monsters if they already met the minimum Level requirement.</p>
	<p style="color: white; font-size: 200%" align="left">Monsters that do not have Levels, such as Xyz Monsters and Link Monsters, cannot be Tributed for a Ritual Summon.</p>
	<p style="color: white; font-size: 200%" align="left">A player can activate a card or effect that Ritual Summons even if all of their Main Monster Zones are used, but only
	if they Tribute one of their monsters on the field when that card or effect resolves (if all their Main Monster Zones are still occupied by that point).</p>
	<p style="color: white; font-size: 200%" align="left">Face-down monsters can be Tributed for a Ritual Summon, unless the card text specifies otherwise (such as "Forbidden Arts of the Gishki").</p>
	<p style="color: white; font-size: 200%" align="left">As long as the monster is not returned to the hand or Deck, it is considered to have been originally properly Special Summoned, so it can
	still be Special Summoned from the Graveyard or while banished.</p>
	<p style="color: white; font-size: 200%" align="left">Not all Ritual Spell Cards require the player to tribute monsters from their hand/field. In such cases, follow the card effect and its requirements.</p>
	<h4 style="color: white; font-size: 250%; text-align: left; font-family: Times New Roman;">Synchro summoning</h4>
	<img src="./images/sync.jpg" align="left" style="border: 3px solid red;" height="356px" width="250px">
	<p style="color: white; font-size: 200%" align="left">A Synchro Summon is the act of Special Summoning a Synchro Monster from the Extra Deck using a Tuner monster with additional non-Tuner monsters.</p>
	<p style="color: white; font-size: 200%" align="left">During their Main Phase, the turn player can Synchro Summon a Synchro Monster from face-down in their Extra Deck by sending two or more face-up monsters
	listed on the Synchro Monster Card, including exactly 1 Tuner (unless stated otherwise), whose combined Levels exactly equal the Synchro Monster's Level, from their field to the Graveyard as Synchro Materials.
	After that, the player Summons the Synchro Monster from the Extra Deck in an unoccupied Main Monster Zone or an Extra Monster Zone in face-up Attack or Defense Position.</p>
	<p style="color: white; font-size: 200%" align="left">Monsters that do not have Levels, such as Xyz Monsters and Link Monsters, cannot be used as Synchro Materials. Token Monsters and Trap Monsters can be used as Synchro Materials.</p>
	<p style="color: white; font-size: 200%" align="left">Synchro Materials are sent to the Graveyard by default, but the Synchro Summon is still successful even if the materials are moved to some other location instead. For example,
	it is still possible to perform a Synchro Summon while "Macro Cosmos" is active or using Pendulum Monsters as materials, in which case the materials will be banished or placed face-up in the Extra Deck, respectively.</p>
	<p style="color: white; font-size: 200%" align="left">Even if all appropriate Monster Zones are occupied, a Synchro Monster can still be Synchro Summoned as long as at least one of the Synchro Materials used is in one
	of these zones, so that there is an available zone when the Synchro Monster is Summoned.</p>
	<p style="color: white; font-size: 200%" align="left">A Synchro Summon is a type of built-in Special Summon, so it can be negated by cards like "Solemn Warning" and "Thunder King Rai-Oh". Even if a Synchro Summon is negated,
	the Synchro Materials do not return to the field.</p>
	<p style="color: white; font-size: 200%" align="left">Even if a monster lists a specific monster as materials, such as "Majestic Star Dragon", the Summon must use exactly 1 Tuner (unless otherwise specified). For example,
	if you have 2 "Phantom of Chaos", 1 being treated as "Majestic Dragon", and the other equipped with "Synchro Boost" and "Torque Tune Gear" and being treated as "Stardust Dragon", and a Level 1 non-Tuner monster, you can
	still Synchro Summon. However, if neither "Phantom" is a Tuner, or if both are, the Summon cannot be performed.</p>
	<p style="color: white; font-size: 200%" align="left">Like other Extra Deck monsters, if a Synchro Monster is not Synchro Summoned first, it cannot be Special Summoned from the Graveyard or while banished
	(unless it specifies another way to properly Special Summon it, in which case it must first be Summoned that way).</p>
	<p style="color: white; font-size: 200%" align="left">For example, if a Synchro Monster is Special Summoned from the Extra Deck by the effect of "Shadow Impulse" and sent to the Graveyard, or was sent
	from face-down in the Extra Deck to the Graveyard by "Gale Dogra", it cannot be Special Summoned from the Graveyard by "Premature Burial"; however, if it was originally Synchro Summoned, it can be
	Special Summoned from the Graveyard by "Premature Burial".</p>
	<p style="color: white; font-size: 200%" align="left">Apart from the basic method of performing a Synchro Summon outlined above, certain cards allow the controller to perform a Synchro Summon outside of its parameters.</p>
	<h4 style="color: white; font-size: 250%; text-align: left; font-family: Times New Roman;">XYZ summoning</h4>
	<img src="./images/xyz.jpg" align="right" style="border: 3px solid red;" height="356px" width="250px">
	<p style="color: white; font-size: 200%" align="left">An Xyz Summon (pronounced ik-seez) is the act of Special Summoning an Xyz Monster from the Extra Deck by overlaying at least 2 monsters with the same Level.</p>
	<p style="color: white; font-size: 200%" align="left">During their Main Phase, the turn player can Xyz Summon an Xyz Monster from their Extra Deck by vertically stacking two (or more, if required/possible)
	face-up monsters with the same Level as the Xyz Monster's Rank, that are listed on it as Xyz Materials. After that, the player Summons the Xyz Monster from the Extra Deck in face-up Attack or Defense Position
	to an unoccupied Main Monster Zone or an Extra Monster Zone, placing it on top of the stacked Xyz Materials. The Materials used are attached (stacking) under the Xyz Monster, until later detached by Card Effects.</p>
	<p style="color: white; font-size: 200%" align="left">Monsters that do not have Levels, such as Xyz Monsters and Link Monsters, cannot normally be used as Xyz Materials for an Xyz Summon, unless played otherwise.</p>
	<p style="color: white; font-size: 200%" align="left">Even if all appropriate Monster Zones are occupied, an Xyz Monster can still be Xyz Summoned as long as at least one of the Xyz Materials used is in one of these Zones, 
	so that there is an available Zone when the Xyz Monster is Summoned.</p>
	<p style="color: white; font-size: 200%" align="left">An Xyz Summon is a kind of built-in Special Summon, like Contact Fusion, Pendulum Summon, Synchro Summon or the Special Summon of a monster like "Black Luster Soldier - Envoy of the Beginning",
	therefore it does not start a Chain.</p>
	<p style="color: white; font-size: 200%" align="left">Xyz Monsters frequently have effects that require you to remove an Xyz Material(s) from beneath it, known as detaching. When this happens, 
	take the necessary Xyz Materials, and put them in the Graveyard.</p>
	<p style="color: white; font-size: 200%" align="left">Xyz Materials currently attached to an Xyz Monster are neither treated as monsters, nor treated as being on the field.</p>
	<p style="color: white; font-size: 200%" align="left">Trap Monsters and Pseudo-Trap Monsters can be used as Xyz Materials.</p>
	<p style="color: white; font-size: 200%" align="left">Tokens cannot be used as Xyz Materials, as Tokens cannot be in any state other than being on the field.</p>
	<p style="color: white; font-size: 200%" align="left">The battle positions of the monsters to be used as Xyz Material does not matter as long as they are in face-up position. However, once you have Xyz Summoned your Xyz Monster, 
	ensure that the entire stack is neatly aligned in face-up Attack Position, regardless of which Battle position the Xyz Monster is currently in.</p>
	<p style="color: white; font-size: 200%" align="left">An Xyz Monster Special Summoned via any means other than an Xyz Summon will not have any Xyz Materials (unless given to it by a card effect, such as "Xyz Reborn").</p>
	<p style="color: white; font-size: 200%" align="left">If an Xyz Monster leaves the field or otherwise ceases to be a monster (such as being treated as an Equip Card by "Destiny HERO - Plasma", or being treated as an Xyz Material
	by the effect of "Number 101: Silent Honor ARK" or for the Xyz Summon of "Number F0: Utopic Future"), its Xyz Materials are sent to the Graveyard, unless the card effect says otherwise, such as those of the "Rank-Up-Magic" archetype.</p>
	<p style="color: white; font-size: 200%" align="left">If an Xyz Monster is flipped face-down, its Xyz Materials remain attached to it.</p>
	<p style="color: white; font-size: 200%" align="left">If a card effect banishes all cards that would be sent to the Graveyard (such as "Macro Cosmos" or "Banisher of the Radiance"), then when an Xyz Monster leaves the field, its Xyz
	Materials will be banished. An Xyz Monster can still detach its Materials while such an effect is active; the Xyz Materials will be banished instead of being sent to the Graveyard.</p>
	<p style="color: white; font-size: 200%" align="left">Apart from the basic method of performing an Xyz Summon outlined above, certain cards allow the controller to perform an Xyz Summon outside of its parameters. Usually through "Rank-Up-Magic" cards or "Xyz Evolution".</p>
	<h4 style="color: white; font-size: 250%; text-align: left; font-family: Times New Roman;">Pendulum summoning</h4>
	<img src="./images/pend.jpg" align="left" style="border: 3px solid red;" height="356px" width="250px">
	<p style="color: white; font-size: 200%" align="left">A Pendulum Summon is a form of Special Summon introduced in Yu-Gi-Oh! ARC-V. Pendulum Summoning allows the player to Summon multiple monsters simultaneously.</p>
	<p style="color: white; font-size: 200%" align="left">Once per turn, during the Main Phase, if the turn player has a card with a Pendulum Scale in each of their two Pendulum Zones (for a total of 2 cards),
	that player can Pendulum Summon any number of monsters from their hand, and/or any number of face-up Pendulum Monsters in their Extra Deck, whose individual Levels or the Level written in the condition,
	if any, of an Xyz Pendulum Monster are exclusively between the Pendulum Scales of the cards in their Pendulum Zones (i.e. monsters whose individual Levels/Ranks are between the Pendulum Scales and 
	not the same as the Pendulum Scales' values).</p>
	<p style="color: white; font-size: 200%" align="left">When performing a Pendulum Summon, Pendulum Monster(s) that are face-up in the Extra Deck must be Summoned to an unoccupied Main Monster Zone
	that a Link Monster points to or an Extra Monster Zone. Monsters that are Pendulum Summoned from the hand are Summoned to any Main Monster Zones.</p>
	<p style="color: white; font-size: 200%" align="left">Due to Levels and Ranks restrictions, no monsters can be Pendulum Summoned if cards in Pendulum Zones have Pendulum Scales that differ by one or less (i.e. 4 and 4, 3 and 4). 
	However, this has no impact on Pendulum Effects.</p>
	<p style="color: white; font-size: 200%" align="left">A Pendulum Summon is a built-in Special Summon, so it can be negated by cards like "Solemn Warning" and "Thunder King Rai-Oh"; however, if more than 1 monster would be Pendulum Summoned
	at the same time, cards like "Black Horn of Heaven" (which specify they can only be activated when exactly 1 monster would be Summoned) cannot be activated.</p>
	<p style="color: white; font-size: 200%" align="left">Pendulum Summoning is unrelated to the effects of the Pendulum Monsters in the Pendulum Zones, and can be
	performed even if their effects are negated (such as due to the effect of "Vector Pendulum, the Dracoverlord").</p>
	<h4 style="color: white; font-size: 250%; text-align: left; font-family: Times New Roman;">Link summoning</h4>
	<img src="./images/link.jpg" align="right" style="border: 3px solid red;" height="356px" width="250px">
	<p style="color: white; font-size: 200%" align="left">A Link Summon is the act of Special Summoning a Link Monster from the Extra Deck.</p>
	<p style="color: white; font-size: 200%" align="left">During their Main Phase, if the game state is open, the turn player can Link Summon
	a Link Monster from their Extra Deck by sending face-up monsters they control equal to the Link Monster's Link Rating to the Graveyard 
	as Link Materials. After that, the Link Monster is Summoned in either an Extra Monster Zone or a Main Monster Zone that a Link Monster 
	on the field points to, in face-up Attack Position.</p>
	<p style="color: white; font-size: 200%" align="left">When using a Link Monster for a Link Summon, it can be treated as 1 Link Material, 
	OR multiple Link Materials equal to its own Link Rating.</p>
