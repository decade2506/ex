<hr>
<p style="color: white; font-size: 200%" align="left">Like in the Anime, the Yu-Gi-Oh! TCG and OCG playstyles is basicly to reduce the opponent's life point(LP) to 0.</p>
<p style="color: white; font-size: 200%" align="left">Though it's not that simple. There card type in this world of Yu-Gi-Oh! including monster, spell and trap.</p>
<img src="./images/darkmag.jpg" align="left" style="border: 3px solid red;" height="356px" width="250px">
<p style="color: white; font-size: 200%" align="left">Monster card is pretty self-explainatory. There is many type of monsters but the most commonly use is Normal and Effect.
Normal monster is a vanilla card with ATK and DEF that's it there is nothing special.</p>

<p style="color: white; font-size: 200%" align="left">Effect monster on the otherwise have special abilities that can activate in the game. There
is one thing to keep in mind there are level between monsters, if the level is lower than 4 you can normal summon your monster, and from 5 and higher you need to tribute summon (5-6: 1 monster; 6+: 2 monsters; some special card need 3 monsters)</p>
<p style="color: white; font-size: 200%" align="left">Though there are monster that can be special summon which i will talk about in summoning archtype</p>
<p style="color: white; font-size: 200%" align="left">And aside from monster there are Spell and trap cards. This can bring the strategic side of Yu-Gi-Oh! by combining them with monster cards.
There are a variety of spell and trap cards and they has their own set of abilities. Trap card is different from spell card, it has to be set before activation and can really help you in
dire situation.</p>

<p style="color: white; font-size: 200%" align="left">Like i said before you win by reducing the opponent's LP to 0. But it's not always that simple there are something called winning
condition. What that means is that you can win with certain abilities of card. A famous example of this is Exodia in which you must have 5 parts of Exodia the forbiden one in the hand to win and so on.</p>
