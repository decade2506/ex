 game developed and published by Konami. Based on the Duel Monsters concept from the original manga series, the game sees players
 using a combination of monsters, spells, and traps to defeat their opponent. First launched in Japan in 1999, the game has received
 various changes over the years, such as the inclusion of new monster types to coincide with the release of new anime series.

 <p style="color: white; font-size: 200%" align="left">Not only in the real world, Yu-Gi-Oh! continues to dominate the online format of TCG which is called Online card game
Like I suggest, OCG is the online format of TCG, it's pretty much the same type of game but it will be more caculative since in OCG there are perks that the TCG lack of. 
It's the same for Yu-gi-oh! so because of that people are quite Welcoming to the OCG Yu-Gi-Oh!</p>
