		<p style="color: white; font-size: 220%">Yu-Gi-Oh! (Japanese: 遊☆戯☆王, Hepburn: Yū-Gi-Ō!, lit. "Game King") is a Japanese manga
		series written and illustrated by Kazuki Takahashi. It was serialized in Shueisha's Weekly 
		Shōnen Jump magazine between September 1996 and March 2004. The plot follows the story of a
		boy named Yugi Mutou, who solves the ancient Millennium Puzzle. Yugi awakens a gambling alter-ego
		or spirit within his body that solves his conflicts using various games.

The manga series has spawned a media franchise that includes multiple spin-off manga and anime series, a
 trading card game, and numerous video games. Most of these incarnations involve the fictional trading card
 game known as Duel Monsters, where each player uses cards to "duel" each other in a mock battle of fantasy "monsters",
 forming the basis for the real life Yu-Gi-Oh! Trading Card Game tie in. The manga was adapted into two anime series; the
 first anime adaptation was produced by Toei Animation, which aired from April to October 1998, while the second, produced
 by NAS and animated by Studio Gallop titled Yu-Gi-Oh! Duel Monsters, aired between April 2000 and September 2004. Yu-Gi-Oh!
 has since become one of the highest-grossing media franchises of all time.</p>
